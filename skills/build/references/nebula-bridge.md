# The Nebula bridge: every Nebula call this skill makes

Written against Nebula 3.47.0. `NEBULA` is the `root` that `scripts/nebula-root.mjs` printed.
Every CLI call below starts with its `cli` line, written here as `NEB`:

```
NEB = bash "$NEBULA/scripts/run-node.sh" "$NEBULA/scripts/nebula.mjs"
```

Always add `--json`. Claude Code supplies `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`; when a command fails for a
missing session id, choose one stable id for the whole session and append `--session <id>` to
every command from then on. Never generate a new one per command.

## Setup

Mirror Nebula's `start` skill from the CLI, taking answers from the profile instead of asking.

1. `NEB state next --json`.
   - `continue_solution`: this folder already holds a solution. Use `folderSolution.tenant`
     and `folderSolution.id`, whatever the profile says, and write a ledger row
     `solution · kept the folder's <name> · MODERATOR`. Go to step 3 with that tenant.
   - `handoff`: use `handoff.tenant` and `handoff.solutionId` or `handoff.solutionName`.
   - `ask_tenant`: the tenant is the profile's `tenant` line, or the host of a builder link
     the person typed in the request. Run `NEB state next --tenant <host> --json`.
2. `login`: run `bash "$NEBULA/scripts/run-node.sh" "$NEBULA/scripts/login.mjs" <host> --check`.
   Exit 0: signed in. Exit 3 or `AUTH_EXPIRED`: this is the one setup stop. Ask ONE
   AskUserQuestion, header `Sign in`, question `How would you like to sign in to <host>?`,
   options `Open browser` and `Enter cookie manually`, and then do exactly what Nebula's
   `start` skill's `login` row says for each (read it at
   `$NEBULA/skills/start/SKILL.md`, the table row `login`): the browser wrapper with a
   300000 ms Bash timeout, or the cookie passed on stdin with `--manual`, never on a command
   line or echoed. Then `NEB solution storage-check --tenant <host> --json` and
   `NEB state next --tenant <host> --after-login --json`.
3. `pick_solution`: the solution is the profile's `solution` line.
   - `NEB solution resolve "<name>" --tenant <host> --json`. Exactly one `exact: true` match:
     `NEB solution open --tenant <host> --id <id> --mode sonic --request "<request>" --json`.
     No match: `NEB solution create --tenant <host> --name "<name>" --mode sonic --request "<request>" --json`.
     Several inexact matches and no exact one: create, and log the row.
   - `WORKSPACE_SOLUTION_MISMATCH`: the folder holds another solution; rerun step 1's
     `continue_solution` branch with it. Never pass `--override-folder` on your own.
   - `WORKSPACE_CONTENT_CONFLICT`: stop and show Nebula's message; the person must start in
     an empty folder.
   - `PLATFORM_UNREACHABLE` with `localFallback: true`: rerun the create once with
     `--storage local`, and log the row.
   - `PRODUCTION_BLOCKED` or `ENVIRONMENT_UNCONFIRMED`: show the message as it is and stop.
4. `NEB solution mode sonic --json` (harmless when `--mode sonic` already recorded it), then
   `NEB solution context --json`. Check `mode` is `sonic`. Keep `memory`, `features`,
   `plans` and `linkedEntities` for the Scout's message.
5. `NEB solution refresh --json` before the Scout starts, so the cache is current.

## Reads

The Scout reads cache first and live only for what the cache never holds, exactly as
`$NEBULA/skills/sonic-scoping/SKILL.md` §1 says. The commands, for the Scout's message:

- `NEB entity context solution --json`: every linked app, object, automation, AI agent.
- `NEB cache app <appId>`, `cache nav <appId>`, `cache paths <appId>`: an app, its menu,
  its page addresses.
- `NEB cache outline <pageId> --app-id <appId>`, `cache blocks … --name <block>`,
  `cache ds --app-id <appId>`, `cache events <pageId> --app-id <appId>`.
- `NEB cache obj <objectId>`: fields and indexes. `cache wf <id> --contract`: an
  automation's inputs and outputs. `cache agent <id>`: an AI agent.
- `NEB cache limits`: what is never cached (records, connections, runs, AI agent parts).
  Those are live reads with the read tools of each server, and so is the global search a new
  name needs: `get_objects` on a new `OBJ_` id, `search` with an object's exact name,
  `get_app_overview` on a new app id, `search_workflows` with an automation's exact name.

Never pipe a cache answer through `grep`, `sed` or `head`: a filter hides the line that says
what to run instead.

## Files to read from Nebula at run time

Read these from `NEBULA`, never copy them into Studio: they move with Nebula.

## Brief

1. Write the brief at `$STUDIO/<brief-slug>.md` in the exact shape of `brief-template.md`:
   `## Goal`, `## Touches`, `## Changes`, `## Rules`, `## Ready when`, `## Assumptions`.
   `## Changes` in builder order: objects, record seeds, automations, the `app look` line,
   pages each with `job` and `design`, app navigation. Every `<…>` filled; literal angle
   brackets in code spans. Under about forty lines when it fits; a demo may run longer, and
   Studio never offers the Zen escalation.
2. `NEB fast brief --title "<title>" --md-file "$STUDIO/<brief-slug>.md" --json`. It refuses
   a missing heading, a look line in words or failing contrast, a font not on the list, a
   look line below a job line, a page without job or design, a deploy or publish naming
   nothing in `## Touches`. Fix exactly what it names.

## Build

1. `NEB fast accept --draft <slug> --execution plan --json`. Sonic's default is
   `no-ask-before-deploy`, so every deploy and publish in `## Ready when` runs without a
   further yes. Do not pass `--ask-before-deploy`.
2. Load `nebula:sonic-plan` with the Skill tool and follow it with policy `subsequent`: it
   turns `## Changes` and `## Ready when` into the task graph, writes the JSON under
   `.sessions/<sessionId>/drafts/`, runs `plan create --spec <specId> --tasks-file <json> --json`,
   then `plan start <planId> --json`, with no plan shown and no question.
3. Follow `run-loop.md` exactly: `NEB plan ready <planId> --mark --json` groups ready work
   and writes each builder's message file; start each builder named in `send` with the
   Agent tool (`nebula:app-agent`, `nebula:fde-agent`, `nebula:automation-agent`,
   `nebula:agent-builder`, `nebula:page-reviewer`) using the exact prompt the reply gives;
   pass the returned agent ids back with `--agent-ids`; record each report as the loop says.
   The Studio overrides are in SKILL.md § Act 3.
4. When `plan ready` exits 5, the plan is no longer in progress: `NEB plan finish <planId> --json`
   and keep its `entityTable` and `notes`.

## Later task (a fix, or Next task)

This is Nebula's `sonic-routing` §5 path, which asks nothing.

1. `NEB solution refresh --json`. Read only what the fix touches, cache first.
2. Write the smallest valid brief from the fix line (one `## Changes` line when possible, the
   page it touches under `## Touches`, `publish <app>` under `## Ready when` when the change
   is invisible until published) at `$STUDIO/<fix-slug>.md`.
3. `NEB fast brief --title "<title>" --md-file <path> --json`, then
   `NEB fast accept --draft <slug> --json`. Present neither.
4. Load `nebula:sonic-plan` with policy `subsequent`; it creates and starts the plan. Run the
   loop as in § Build, then `plan finish`.

## Finish

1. `NEB plan get <planId> --json` for the last plan's results.
2. Feature documents: `NEB feature upsert --file <json> --json`, one per feature, in the shape
   `$NEBULA/skills/zen-routing/references/feature-template.md` gives, keeping app and page
   documentation apart from automation documentation.
3. Memory: `NEB memory remember <decisions|corrections|errors|notes> "<text>" --plan <planId> --json`
   only for a fact the spec and plan will not carry forward: an unexplained failure, a tenant
   fact, a correction. Not for the Stand-in's ordinary decisions, which the runbook lists.
4. `NEB solution context --json` so later requests see the persisted `execution` and plans.

## Links and addresses

- An entity's platform link: `NEB entity link <kind> <id> [--app-id <id>] [--object-id <id>] --json`.
- A page's preview address, for the Rehearsal script: `https://<host>/p/0/interfaces/<appId>/preview/<path>`
  where `<path>` comes from `NEB cache paths <appId>`; a detail page takes a real record id in
  place of its `:param`. The published address is on another host and shows a sign-in page to
  a browser that `open-page` started, so Rehearsal walks the preview route and the runbook
  lists both.
