# Demo Studio: Quick Guide

Demo Studio builds a ready-to-present UnifyApps demo from one sentence. You type what you want, and it does the rest.

## Before you start

You need two things, both already set up on your Mac:

- The **Nebula** plugin, which does the actual building.
- The **Demo Studio** plugin, version 0.2.0.

Optional but useful: Slack connected, so it can read what the client said.

## Step by step

**1. Open a new Claude Code session in an empty folder.**
Use the desktop app's Code tab or the terminal. One folder holds one demo.

**2. (Optional, once per client) Save a client profile.**
This tells Demo Studio about the client so it never has to ask.

```
/demo-studio:profile Acme Logistics · site acmelogistics.com · audience COO, 20 minutes · tenant orbit.uat.unifyapps.com
```

Skip this and Demo Studio drafts a profile for you.

**3. Ask for the demo.**

```
/demo-studio:build Build a demo for Acme Logistics: fleet maintenance with approvals and an AI assistant, for their COO.
```

**4. Sign in, if asked.**
The only thing it may ask you is to sign in to the tenant. Pick "Open browser" and sign in.

**5. Wait.**
You will see short progress lines, such as "Round 1: picked a storyline" and "Task 3 of 14 done". Behind the scenes it:

- reads Slack, your email and your calendar for what the client asked for and who is coming,
- reads the client's website for colours, fonts, logo and layout, and writes a design brief from them,
- proposes ways to use platform features (agents, evaluations, context graph) in the demo,
- decides if the client wants to see the use case, how the platform is set up, or both,
- picks one storyline and cuts anything the demo does not use,
- builds it with Nebula,
- clicks through the finished demo in a browser and fixes what looks wrong,
- writes a prompt for the Code Builder, builds the app there if you asked for it, and has a critic review the look against the client's brand,
- writes an explainer with diagrams so anyone can understand what was built.

**6. Open the runbook.**
When it finishes, it gives you a link to `<Client> Demo Runbook.md`. That is your guide for the day.

## What you get at the end

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| A working, published demo app in the client's colours and fonts | On your UnifyApps tenant, with a live link |
| The data, automations and AI assistant behind it, with sample records | On your tenant, inside the solution |
| A **demo script**: what to say and click at each step, with a screenshot of each | In the runbook |
| Links to every page, object and automation | In the runbook |
| What the AI assistant answered in rehearsal | In the runbook |
| A list of **decisions it made for you**, and how to change them next time | In the runbook |
| An **explainer** with flowcharts: what each object, automation, agent and page does and how data flows | `<Client> Demo Explainer.html` (and `.md`) |
| A **Text2Code prompt** with the real ids, to build the same demo in the Code Builder | `<Client> Text2Code Prompt.md` |
| The **code app** itself, when your profile says `frontend: code` or `both` | On your tenant, with a live link in the runbook |
| A saved client profile, so the next demo for this client is faster | `studio/profiles/<client>.md` |

## When it will stop and ask you

Only for these four things:

1. Signing in, when your login has expired.
2. Deleting anything.
3. A password or connection the tenant does not have.
4. A demo too big for the budget, when it cannot cut it down.

## Tips

- **Say who is watching and for how long.** It shapes the whole demo.
- **Name the client's website.** That is where the look comes from.
- **Check "Decisions taken for you" in the runbook.** Add those answers to the client profile and the next demo will be closer to what you want.
- **Want a change after it is done?** Just type it, for example "make the approve button bigger". It builds the fix without asking anything.
